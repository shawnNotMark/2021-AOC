# 2021-AOC

As a challenge I wanted to see if I could do the advent of code in 5 different languages. Going in I knew a fair amount of Python but hadn't touched java and ruby for a long time. Completely learning Erlang and Go as new languages 

Days 1-5 Are done in Python 3
Days 6-10 Are done in Erlang
Days 11-15 Are done in Ruby
Days 16-20 Are done in Go
Days 21-25 Are done in Java
